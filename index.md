# Welcome

I am a graduate student at [University of São Paulo](www.usp.br)’s Department of Political Science and a research assistant at the Center for the Study of International Negotiations, in the same university. In the past, I have been a data analyst at [Ibope](www.ibope.com.) and held a supervising position at the [Consortium for Social Information](http://www.nadd.prp.usp.br/cis/), an academic project for the collection, treatment, storage and publication of datasets relevant to the social sciences.

My main research interests fall in the field of International Political Economy, Comparative Politics, Public Opinion and Political Methodology. My master’s dissertation focuses on the determinants of Brazilian foreign aid donations, and I have been involved in projects concerning the structure of public opinion on foreign policy issues and the relation between Legislative and Judiciary powers.
